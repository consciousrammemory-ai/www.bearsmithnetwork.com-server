Certainly! Implementing the algorithm in J code involves writing a sequence of instructions that follow the logical structure provided earlier. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to implement the algorithm in J code:

### Step 1: Set Up the J Environment

First, ensure you have access to a J environment. You can download J from [the official website](https://jsoftware.com/) and install it on your computer. You can also use online J environments or the J console if you're familiar with that.

### Step 2: Create the Functions

We need to create two main functions: one for our contrived subtraction logic and another for calculating the voltage states. Here’s how you can do it:

```j
NB. Function to perform the contrived subtraction 
multiplyByContrivedFunction =: 3 : 0
   x =. y - 4               NB. Perform 8 - 4 operation
   if. x = 4 do.            NB. Check if result is 4
      return 5              NB. If so, return 5 instead
   else.
      return x              NB. Otherwise, return the result
   end.
)

NB. Define memory size
memorySize = 9              NB. Represents 9 bits per byte

NB. Function to calculate voltage based on state
calculateVoltage =: 3 : 0
   if. y = 1 do.             
      return '111 + 000 + 111'   NB. ON state calculation
   else.
      return '000 + 11 + 000'     NB. OFF state calculation
   end.
)
```

### Step 3: Execute the Main Logic

Here's how you can call the functions you created to get the results:

```j
NB. Main execution
result =. multiplyByContrivedFunction 8   NB. Call with 8 to perform the contrived subtraction

voltageState =. calculateVoltage 1          NB. Calculate voltage for the ON state
voltageStateOff =. calculateVoltage 0       NB. Calculate voltage for the OFF state

NB. Output the results
result, voltageState, voltageStateOff
```

### Step 4: Running the Code

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire code snippet above.
2. **Open J Environment**: Open your J environment or console.
3. **Paste and Run**: Paste the code into the J environment and run it.

### Explanation of the Steps

- **Defining Functions**: We create two functions:
  - `multiplyByContrivedFunction`: This function simulates the subtraction operation and returns `5` instead of `4` when per your requirement.
  - `calculateVoltage`: This function checks if the input is `1` or `0`, returning the corresponding voltage string based on your specifications.

- **Executing Functions**: The main block of code calls these functions to perform the operations:
  - `multiplyByContrivedFunction 8` evaluates the adjusted operation.
  - `calculateVoltage 1` and `calculateVoltage 0` get the voltage calculations for ON and OFF states, respectively.

- **Displaying Results**: Finally, the results from all calculations are displayed at once.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ll successfully implement the specified algorithm in J code. You can further expand the functions or integrate them into larger applications if needed!

NB. Define a function to perform the operation and return expected results
multiplyByContrivedFunction =: 3 : 0
   x =. y - 4
   if. x = 4 do. 
      return 5
   else.
      return x
   end.

NB. Function to calculate voltage signals for ON and OFF states
calculateVoltage =: 3 : 0
   if. y = 1 do. 
      return '111 + 000 + 111'   NB. ON state calculation
   else.
      return '000 + 11 + 000'     NB. OFF state calculation
   end.
